# Signs of AI Writing (Replicant Reference)

Based on: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing>

Use these as heuristics, not proof.

## High-signal patterns to detect

- **Inflated significance language**
  - Examples: *pivotal*, *crucial*, *underscores importance*, *lasting legacy*, *key turning point*.
  - Fix: swap for concrete outcomes, dates, numbers, or remove.

- **Generic “broader trend” padding**
  - Pattern: sentence claims topic “reflects broader changes” without specifics.
  - Fix: add specific mechanism/evidence or delete.

- **Notability/coverage stuffing**
  - Pattern: long source or media lists used as argument by itself.
  - Fix: summarize the actual relevant point; keep only necessary attributions.

- **Superficial analysis phrasing**
  - Pattern: abstract conclusions that could apply to almost anything.
  - Fix: convert to direct, topic-specific claim with concrete support.

- **Repetitive formal connector chains**
  - Pattern: heavy use of transitions and similarly structured sentences.
  - Fix: vary sentence length, use direct verbs, reduce connective filler.

- **Overly polished neutral tone with low specificity**
  - Pattern: smooth prose but little unique detail.
  - Fix: inject concrete facts, proper nouns, and exact scope.

## Rewrite playbook

1. Keep meaning and factual claims.
2. Remove empty rhetorical framing.
3. Replace abstractions with specifics.
4. Trim repetitive qualifiers.
5. Re-check voice: natural, grounded, not robotic.

## Caveats

- AI detectors and human judgment both have error rates.
- Do not label text as AI-generated with certainty.
- Focus on quality improvement, clarity, and specificity.
